The client captures that search and sends it off to my Express server. The Express server sends an AJAX request to the Halo Waypoint API and in response recieves data about the searched Gamertag's Warzone record in Halo 5. The response is handled by my Express server and data from the response is sent to a Firebase database. The client is listening for changes to the database and populates the DOM based on the information inside the Firebase database."
                  ,"One hurdle I had to get through was the API calls to the Halo Waypoint API- I could not do it from the client and had to learn how to make AJAX requests using Express. It was a challenge, yet I came away with a good grasp of working with a database and how to use NodeJS beyond setting up a devServer."]
