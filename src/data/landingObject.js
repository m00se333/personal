    content: ['I began computer programming as a way to jettison myself out of a post-LSAT funk that after a full year of ups and downs turned into a full-blown career path switch. After or before work I began watching a video series that covered basic HTML and CSS. It was interesting and different plus I felt really empowered sitting on the computer for a few hours and being able to produce something that looked like a web page. I still have the original files for my first ever project “herosclips.com”.',
              'After heroesclips I started watching the Full Stack JavaScript video series on teamtreehouse.com. I learned a lot of what I consider the foundation of my JavaScript knowledge: vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS/Express, Git, looking up documentation, and Back End vs. Front End. The learning accomplished in this six month chunk was valuable because for nearly every concept listed there was a little companion project or series of projects that solidified the information in the videos. At this point in time I took on my first freelance project for a local school district: a static informational website that I built with a back and front end. I made some money off of the skills that I was learning and from that point I began to see computer programming as a career.',
              'Something else dawned on me- learning alone with impersonal videos made it hard to keep morale up. So I enrolled in a coding bootcamp named General Assembly and spent three months learning from professionals. It was awesome! I made friends and JavaScript began to make a lot more sense and no longer was this magic I learned through videos online. I learned about high order functions, AJAX, APIs, function declaration vs function expression, first-class objects and even got some professional advice. Plus I created a sweet final project.',
              'My final project was a CRUD-capable web app that took in user data and used that data to make an AJAX request to a 3rd party API- I was playing a lot of Halo 5 at the time and I came across the Halo Waypoint API on Reddit. I used it as the 3rd Party API required in my final project. We also had to use a database, so I chose Firebase. I got to work then quickly learned there was a problem with the Halo API: I had to use Node to make the AJAX calls because the API did not support client to API requests only server to API requests. Luckily I spent time learning Node and Express prior to the course or I may not have this MVP today. It’s not pretty but I am very proud of the app; eventually, due to the amount of times my level of access is allowed to request the API per minute, not all of the information the client requests is sent back. A minor setback.',
              'Finally General Assembly gave me a direction going-forward. My instructors recommended highly that I begin to learn React. My first step was learning about Flexbox from Wes Bos where I checked out his teaching style before I enrolled in his React for Beginners course. Time well spent. Right now I am practicing React as much as possible to prepare for jobs (I made this website using Express and React) and I hope to finish the Wes Bos tutorials because I’m close to the ES6 portion. It’s the future, man.']
